      <h1>SVGs vs PNGs: Understanding the Key Differences</h1>
      <div class="blue-container">
        <h2>Scalability: A Key Advantage of SVGs</h2>
        <p>
          The "S" in SVG stands for scalable, which means that SVG images can be
          zoomed in or out without losing any clarity. In contrast, PNG images
          are composed of pixels and can become pixelated when enlarged.
        </p>
        <h2>The Mathematical Foundation of SVGs</h2>
        <p>
          SVGs are created using mathematical equations to draw shapes and
          lines, making them a natural fit for generating graphics that involve
          mathematical concepts. On the other hand, PNGs are raster images
          composed of thousands of pixels, making them better suited for
          photographic images.
        </p>
        <h2>File Size: SVGs Offer a Significant Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Because SVGs can be written in code that describes the shapes and
          lines to draw, they typically have a smaller file size compared to
          PNGs, which require storing information about each individual pixel.
        </p>
        <h2>Compatibility: PNGs Remain a Widely Accepted Option</h2>
        <p>
          While SVGs are gaining popularity, there are still some websites and
          platforms that only support PNG and JPEG file formats. However, it's
          worth noting that SVGs are compatible with Microsoft products and
          Google Docs.
