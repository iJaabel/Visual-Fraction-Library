Other To Do's

- For the fraction division bar, shorten width a bit if the last section is only a partial section to show what fraction of a whole section it would be.
- Instead of covering excess colored groups with white (which looks terrible when saved without a background), only color what is needed or remove excess.
- For fraction division circles, show the portion of the last group as a fraction
- Use an if statement to determine if it's better to alternate between 2 or 3 colors, or even 4
- If more than one row, make the rows more evenly split so it looks better.
